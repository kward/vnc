# vnc
This is a VNC client library written in Go.

This is a complete rewrite of my [kward/go-vnc][/kward/go-vnc] fork from
[mitchellh/go-vnc][/mitchellh/go-vnc]. That library has served me well, but
fundamental modifications I needed to make to better support the handling of
server updates meant refactoring was necessary.
